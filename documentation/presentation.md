## Review

### Functionality: Does the application meet the core requirements of the functional specification?

To assess this, all the below should be 'YES'.

| Measure | Description | Functional? |
| Create profiles | Including basic information (name, bio, skills), profile picture, and links to GitHub/GitLab profiles. | TBC |
| Post code snippets | Share code in various languages with syntax highlighting, titles, descriptions, and tags for categorization | TBC |
| Comment and discuss | Engage in conversations on code snippets, ask questions, provide feedback, and share insights | TBC |
| Collaborate on projects | Create or join project groups, share code repositories, assign tasks, and track progress. | TBC |
| Search and discover | Find relevant code snippets, projects, and users based on keywords, tags, and programming languages. | TBC |

### Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and efficient?

| Measure | Description | Functional? |
| Standard implementation | Have we followed a simple, standard format? | TBC |
| Code commentary | Are comments present and clear, with a consistent standard across files. | TBC |
| Variable naming convention | Is the naming convention consistent and to PEP8 standard. | TBC |
| Efficiency | Is code dry? | TBC |

### Copilot Utilization: How effectively did the team leverage Copilot throughout the development process?

| Measure | Description | Functional? |
| Copilot Use - DB | Are we using CoPilot to do the heavily lifting? | TBC |
| Copilot Use - API | Are we using CoPilot to do the heavily lifting? | TBC |
| Copilot Use - Front End | Are we using CoPilot to do the heavily lifting? | TBC |
| Copilot Use - Tests | Are we using CoPilot to do the heavily lifting? | TBC |
| Copilot Use - Documentation | Are we using CoPilot to do the heavily lifting? | TBC |

### Testing and Documentation: Are the unit tests comprehensive and the documentation clear and informative?

| Measure | Description | Functional? |
| Functional Coverage | Do we have a test set for all key capabilities? | TBC |
| Unit Coverage | Do we have a full set of unit tests? | TBC |

### Containerization(optional): Is the Dockerfile correctly configured for deployment?

| Measure | Description | Functional? |
| File made | Is the docker file created | TBC |
| File tested | Is the docker file proven to be working? | TBC |

## Conclusion
CodeConnect offers a robust solution to improve code sharing and collaboration, ultimately enhancing productivity and project delivery within our organization.
