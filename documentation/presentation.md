## Review

### Functionality: Does the application meet the core requirements of the functional specification?

To assess this, all the below should be 'YES'.

| Capability | Description | Functional? |
| Create profiles | Including basic information (name, bio, skills), profile picture, and links to GitHub/GitLab profiles. | TBC |
| Post code snippets | Share code in various languages with syntax highlighting, titles, descriptions, and tags for categorization | TBC |
| Comment and discuss | Engage in conversations on code snippets, ask questions, provide feedback, and share insights | TBC |
| Collaborate on projects | Create or join project groups, share code repositories, assign tasks, and track progress. | TBC |
| Search and discover | Find relevant code snippets, projects, and users based on keywords, tags, and programming languages. | TBC |


### Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and efficient?

### Copilot Utilization: How effectively did the team leverage Copilot throughout the development process?

### Testing and Documentation: Are the unit tests comprehensive and the documentation clear and informative?

### Containerization(optional): Is the Dockerfile correctly configured for deployment?

## Conclusion
CodeConnect offers a robust solution to improve code sharing and collaboration, ultimately enhancing productivity and project delivery within our organization.
